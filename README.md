# Project Title: Auld Guard 

## Overview

This project aims to increase my understanding of Linux, Docker, Tor, AI, IDS and Networking by repurposing an old gaming PC into a server that can manage lightweight isolated instances for multiple small scale projects using Docker Engine.

## Goals

- ðŸŸ¢  Start from scratch with a fresh install of [Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS](https://ubuntu.com/download/server).
- ðŸ”´  Install [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/).
- ðŸ”´  Create a Docker Network to run [Wetty](https://github.com/butlerx/wetty), [Nginx](https://nginx.org/en/) and [Certbot](https://github.com/certbot/certbot) for easy access to my server via my [DDNS](https://duckdns.org) on any browser.
- ðŸ”´  Bring it all together with Docker Compose.
- ðŸ”´  Harden security for internet facing port (Let's Encrypt SSL/TLS Encryption, HSTS & CSP headers, UFW, Fail2Ban, Rate Limiting, 2FA, Automation of monitoring, audit logs and updates, Recovery Backup.)
- ðŸ”´  [Kali](https://kali.org/) Instance (maybe [Parrot](https://parrotsec.org/), havent played with that yet)
- ðŸ”´  [Tor](https://torproject.org) Relay with [Nyx](https://nyx.torproject.org) Monitoring
- ðŸ”´  Intrusion Detection with [Suricata](https://suricata.io/)
- ðŸ”´  An as yet undecided AI project
- ðŸ”´  And Beyond?

## Lets Begin!

### Clean Slate

This is the easy bit. 

- Headed on over to [Ubuntu Server dowload page](https://ubuntu.com/download/server) and mounted the iso on a USB using [Balena Etcher](https://etcher.balena.io/).
- Dragged the old rig from the deepest darkest corner of my bedroom
- Blew off the dust, powered the old man up and tapped F2 like a madman until I hit BIOS, selected boot from USB, save and reset.
- Followed the instructions, decided against using snap for docker - opting for a clean start, selected option for OpenSSH and.....
- Ubuntu Server up and running, SSH from laptop. 
- Hello, world.
